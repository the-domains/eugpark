**The Beginning**

Let's see how this goes. 

I've never been good with writing, let alone writing my thoughts. (esp my gramarr as u will c) But like some of my peers and friends have been telling me, the more you write the more you will know. 

So what will I write? I'm a seminary student, husband of one year, a church intern, a member of a campus ministry leadership, TV-show addict, coffee loving, social media observer, Golden State Warriors fan. So with that, probably a lot of random stuff. 

Cheers.
